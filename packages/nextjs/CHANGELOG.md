# @wyw-in-js/nextjs

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2524aa4: Release WyW-in-JS v2.

  The v2 release moves the published packages to an ESM-only, Oxc-backed transform and evaluation pipeline and requires Node.js >= 22.0.0.

  Breaking changes and migration notes from v1:

  - CommonJS package entrypoints were removed. Migrate configs and tooling to ESM (`import()` / `.mjs`).
  - The transform path now uses Oxc for parsing, analysis, pre-evaluation rewrites, shaking, collection, and code generation. `@wyw-in-js/babel-preset` remains available as a deprecated compatibility wrapper around the Oxc pipeline.
  - Build-time evaluation now runs through the async ESM evaluator (`vm.SourceTextModule` + runner RPC).
  - The default value resolver is `eval.strategy: "hybrid"`: WyW tries static-first resolution for provable values and falls back to evaluator execution for values that still need runtime module evaluation. Use `eval.strategy: "execute"` for evaluator-only compatibility, or `eval.strategy: "static"` to reject evaluator fallback.
  - The previous top-level `evaluate` option is replaced by `eval.strategy`.
  - Eval IPC and config handling are stricter: unsupported `__wywPreval`, `eval.globals`, and inline non-serializable preset/plugin options now fail with explicit migration errors instead of being silently coerced.
  - `require()` inside eval follows the configured `eval.require` fallback behavior (`warn-and-run`, `error`, or `off`).
  - CSS rule emission order can differ from v1 for equivalent extracted rule sets because the static-first/Oxc pipeline can process preserved imports and rules in a different order. Projects that rely on cascade ties between generated rules should make precedence explicit in selector specificity, composition, or source structure.

### Patch Changes

- 2524aa4: Add native Oxc-backed import resolution for build-time evaluation.

  Hybrid eval resolution now tries a custom resolver first, then native resolution, then the bundler resolver. Native resolution is powered by `oxc-resolver`, discovers `tsconfig.json` by default, and receives static string aliases from Vite, esbuild, webpack, and Next Turbopack integrations while preserving explicitly configured `oxcOptions.resolver.alias` entries.

## 2.0.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- 4fce392: Rename the eval resolver mode from `node` to `native` and resolve native eval imports with `oxc-resolver`. Hybrid eval resolution now tries the custom resolver, then native resolution, then the bundler resolver.

  Native eval resolution now discovers `tsconfig.json` by default. Vite, esbuild, webpack, and Next Turbopack integrations forward static string aliases from their bundler config into native resolver options, while preserving explicitly configured `oxcOptions.resolver.alias` entries.

## 2.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- bd2a46a: WyW-in-JS packages are now ESM-only and require Node.js >= 22.0.0.

  Breaking changes in v2:

  - CJS `require()` package entrypoints were removed; migrate configs/tooling to ESM (`import()` / `.mjs`).
  - Eval moved to the async ESM runner-based pipeline (`vm.SourceTextModule` + broker RPC), which is now the default path in v2.
  - Eval IPC and Babel preset config handling are stricter:
    - unsupported values in `__wywPreval` now fail explicitly instead of being silently coerced through JSON
    - function-valued preset/plugin options are supported when loaded from config files, while inline non-serializable options now error with migration guidance
    - `eval.globals` encoding and invalidation are more predictable and reject unsupported values earlier
  - `require()` inside eval now follows fallback semantics controlled by `eval.require` (`warn-and-run` / `error` / `off`).

  This release also updates the published bundler integrations, adapter coverage,
  and migration/docs around the v2 evaluator contract, and includes cache and
  warm-runner reuse fixes to keep the new evaluator on the expected performance
  path.

- d553b68: Complete the v2 Oxc migration across the core transform and evaluator pipeline.

  This cutover moves the runtime transform path to the Oxc-backed implementation, including module analysis, preeval rewrites, dangerous-code removal, processor application, template dependency extraction, shaker, collect, emit, and the async ESM evaluator flow.

  The public configuration contract is now Oxc-first, with `oxcOptions`, `EvalRule.oxcOptions`, and the `hybrid` resolver mode available across the updated packages. Processor integrations now rely on the engine-neutral `AstService` surface, and the migration includes cache, concurrency, and hot-path performance fixes needed to keep downstream behavior stable after the cutover. `@wyw-in-js/babel-preset` stays available only as a deprecated compatibility wrapper around the Oxc pipeline.

## 1.0.7

### Patch Changes

- c1218dd: Fix Next.js eval crashes by defaulting `importOverrides` for `react` (and JSX runtimes) so build-time evaluation resolves React via Node instead of Next's vendored RSC runtime.

## 1.0.6

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- a936749: Drop Node.js <20 support (Node 18 is EOL).

  Note: WyW `1.0.0` already effectively required Node 20 in practice; this change makes the support policy explicit and
  aligns docs/CI accordingly.

  If DOM emulation is enabled (`features.happyDOM`), but `happy-dom` cannot be loaded via `require()` (ESM-only), WyW will
  fall back to running without DOM and print a one-time warning with guidance.
