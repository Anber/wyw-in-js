# @wyw-in-js/processor-utils

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2524aa4: Release WyW-in-JS v2.

  The v2 release moves the published packages to an ESM-only, Oxc-backed transform and evaluation pipeline and requires Node.js >= 22.0.0.

  Breaking changes and migration notes from v1:

  - CommonJS package entrypoints were removed. Migrate configs and tooling to ESM (`import()` / `.mjs`).
  - The transform path now uses Oxc for parsing, analysis, pre-evaluation rewrites, shaking, collection, and code generation. `@wyw-in-js/babel-preset` remains available as a deprecated compatibility wrapper around the Oxc pipeline.
  - Build-time evaluation now runs through the async ESM evaluator (`vm.SourceTextModule` + runner RPC).
  - The default value resolver is `eval.strategy: "hybrid"`: WyW tries static-first resolution for provable values and falls back to evaluator execution for values that still need runtime module evaluation. Use `eval.strategy: "execute"` for evaluator-only compatibility, or `eval.strategy: "static"` to reject evaluator fallback.
  - The previous top-level `evaluate` option is replaced by `eval.strategy`.
  - Eval IPC and config handling are stricter: unsupported `__wywPreval`, `eval.globals`, and inline non-serializable preset/plugin options now fail with explicit migration errors instead of being silently coerced.
  - `require()` inside eval follows the configured `eval.require` fallback behavior (`warn-and-run`, `error`, or `off`).
  - CSS rule emission order can differ from v1 for equivalent extracted rule sets because the static-first/Oxc pipeline can process preserved imports and rules in a different order. Projects that rely on cascade ties between generated rules should make precedence explicit in selector specificity, composition, or source structure.

### Minor Changes

- 2524aa4: Add a supported processor diagnostics API that lets library-owned processors emit structured non-fatal warnings through WyW.

  This adds:

  - `BaseProcessor.addDiagnostic()` and typed diagnostics helpers in `@wyw-in-js/processor-utils`
  - normalized `diagnostics` output from `@wyw-in-js/transform`
  - diagnostics reporting in `@wyw-in-js/vite` and `@wyw-in-js/cli`

  Existing hard failures and metadata sidecar behavior stay intact.

- 2524aa4: Add an optional processor static evaluation contract. Processors can now describe statically known values as serializable values, class names, selector chains, runtime callbacks, opaque components, or unresolved values with reasons.

  The transform static evaluator now consumes this contract before falling back to legacy eval-time replacement metadata, so processors can provide their own static semantics without relying on transform-specific metadata shapes.

## 2.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- bd2a46a: WyW-in-JS packages are now ESM-only and require Node.js >= 22.0.0.

  Breaking changes in v2:

  - CJS `require()` package entrypoints were removed; migrate configs/tooling to ESM (`import()` / `.mjs`).
  - Eval moved to the async ESM runner-based pipeline (`vm.SourceTextModule` + broker RPC), which is now the default path in v2.
  - Eval IPC and Babel preset config handling are stricter:
    - unsupported values in `__wywPreval` now fail explicitly instead of being silently coerced through JSON
    - function-valued preset/plugin options are supported when loaded from config files, while inline non-serializable options now error with migration guidance
    - `eval.globals` encoding and invalidation are more predictable and reject unsupported values earlier
  - `require()` inside eval now follows fallback semantics controlled by `eval.require` (`warn-and-run` / `error` / `off`).

  This release also updates the published bundler integrations, adapter coverage,
  and migration/docs around the v2 evaluator contract, and includes cache and
  warm-runner reuse fixes to keep the new evaluator on the expected performance
  path.

  Migration guide: https://wyw-in-js.dev/migration/v2

- d553b68: Complete the v2 Oxc migration across the core transform and evaluator pipeline.

  This cutover moves the runtime transform path to the Oxc-backed implementation, including module analysis, preeval rewrites, dangerous-code removal, processor application, template dependency extraction, shaker, collect, emit, and the async ESM evaluator flow.

  The public configuration contract is now Oxc-first, with `oxcOptions`, `EvalRule.oxcOptions`, and the `hybrid` resolver mode available across the updated packages. Processor integrations now rely on the engine-neutral `AstService` surface, and the migration includes cache, concurrency, and hot-path performance fixes needed to keep downstream behavior stable after the cutover. `@wyw-in-js/babel-preset` stays available only as a deprecated compatibility wrapper around the Oxc pipeline.

### Minor Changes

- 69004e7: Add a supported processor diagnostics seam that lets library-owned processors emit structured non-fatal warnings through WyW.

  This adds:

  - `BaseProcessor.addDiagnostic()` and typed diagnostics helpers in `@wyw-in-js/processor-utils`
  - normalized `diagnostics` output from `@wyw-in-js/transform`
  - diagnostics reporting in `@wyw-in-js/vite` and `@wyw-in-js/cli`

  Existing hard failures and metadata sidecar behavior stay intact.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- a936749: Drop Node.js <20 support (Node 18 is EOL).

  Note: WyW `1.0.0` already effectively required Node 20 in practice; this change makes the support policy explicit and
  aligns docs/CI accordingly.

  If DOM emulation is enabled (`features.happyDOM`), but `happy-dom` cannot be loaded via `require()` (ESM-only), WyW will
  fall back to running without DOM and print a one-time warning with guidance.
