# Usage with Bun

### Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @wyw-in-js/bun
```

### Configuration

Bun plugins are configured via the `Bun.build()` API:

```js
import wyw from '@wyw-in-js/bun';

await Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ['src/index.ts'],
  outdir: 'dist',
  plugins: [
    wyw({
      filter: /\.[cm]?[jt]sx?$/,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Keeping CSS comments

WyW can preserve CSS comments (for example, `/*rtl:ignore*/`) via `keepComments`.

Bun currently strips CSS comments in the final extracted CSS output (including directives like `/*rtl:ignore*/`). Bun may keep top-level `/*!...*/` license comments, but comments inside rules are dropped.

```js
wyw({
  keepComments: true,
  // or keep only matching comments:
  // keepComments: /rtl:/,
});
```
