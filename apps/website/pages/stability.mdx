# Stability & Production Readiness

WyW-in-JS is used in production build pipelines and aims to provide a predictable upgrade path.

## Versioning (SemVer)

WyW-in-JS follows SemVer for the published `@wyw-in-js/*` packages.

- `1.0.0` is a “stable baseline” release and introduces no breaking changes compared to the pre-`1.0.0` line.
- `1.x` is the first “stable baseline” line. Breaking changes are introduced only in `2.0.0` and higher.
- `minor` releases add features in a backwards-compatible way.
- `patch` releases are for bugfixes and small improvements.

The pre-`1.0.0` (`0.x`) line existed mostly because the project evolved rapidly, despite being used in real production
setups.

## Why “stable” is non-trivial here

WyW-in-JS does a lot of work at **build time**, including static analysis and evaluating parts of JavaScript to compute
styles and artifacts.

This means it interacts with:

- unbounded user code patterns,
- dependencies with various build-time assumptions,
- bundler-specific resolution behavior.

Because of that, some edge cases are inevitably discovered only on specific codebases. We treat such cases as bugs and
aim to keep regressions rare, but “perfect stability across all possible JS” is not realistic for a build-time evaluator.

## Upgrading safely

- Read the changelog before upgrading (especially when jumping across minor versions).
- Validate the new version on a representative project (or a small repro extracted from it).
- If you hit instability or a major slowdown, see [Troubleshooting: Stability & Performance](/troubleshooting).
- If you hit a regression, please file an issue with:
  - the exact `@wyw-in-js/*` versions,
  - bundler/framework + version,
  - a minimal reproduction (or a small repository/zip), and
  - error logs and stack traces (ideally with `DEBUG=wyw-in-js:*`).

## Support

- Community support happens via GitHub issues and discussions.
- If wyw-in-js is critical to your production workflow, consider supporting the project via GitHub Sponsors:
  https://github.com/sponsors/anber

## Runtime requirements

- Node.js `>=20.0.0` (Node 18 is EOL and not supported).
- Bun `>=1.0.0` (supported via `@wyw-in-js/bun` and for running the workspace with Bun).

## Roadmap (high level)

- `2.0.0` will include breaking changes (for example: moving to an ESM-only architecture and requiring newer Node.js).
- `3.0.0` is focused on performance/scalability work (moving parts of the pipeline to Rust/oxc).
